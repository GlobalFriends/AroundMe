Place List Fragment:
1) Images are not loaded properly
2) Currently only 20 results are shown by Google Places API's we need to use extra token in this response for additional response. These should
be queried only when user performs manual refresh

Place Type Screen:
1) We are using multiple types currently, that can increase user waiting time. Need some improvment there


Detail Screen:
1) Refactoring of overall UI
2) TIming should be clubbed with Open
3) Address and miles should be clubbed together
4) Reviews should have "More button" clickable
5) See if 2 lines only can be shown

General
1) Additional Support for FourSquare and others
2) Need some filtering of types in selection
